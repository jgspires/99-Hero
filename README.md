# 99Hero

## About

A simple Node.js and Express.js-based RESTful API that connects to a MongoDB database containing various superheroes.
CRUD functions can be executed using this API (over a service like Postman) in order to create, remove, update and delete superheroes from an existing database following a predefined schema.

Database schemas are defined internally using Mongoose. MongoDB must be running locally for the webserver to work.

## Operations, Routes and Endpoints

Hero CRUD operations may be performed by accessing "99Hero/heroes" using either POST, GET, PUT or DELETE.
For now, please see source code for any potential parameters and hero schema structure.

"Announcing" disasters may be done by accessing "99Hero/heroes/anuncio?desastre=DISASTER_NAME&cidade=CITY_NAME".

Valid disasters are (in portuguese): "assalto a banco", "monstro gigante" and "desastre natural".
Valid cities are: "New York", "Rio de Janeiro" and "TÃ³quio".

Valid cities and disasters may be added or removed by changing their respective arrays in the "constants.js" file in the root folder.
