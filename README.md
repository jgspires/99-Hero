## About

A simple Node.js and Express.js-based RESTful API that connects to a MongoDB database containing various superheroes.
CRUD functions can be executed using this API in order to create, remove, update and delete superheroes from an existing database following a predefined schema.

Database schemas are defined internally using Mongoose. MongoDB must be running locally for the webserver to work.
